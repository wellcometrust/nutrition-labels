			<p> The datasets represented by these labels are some of the most commonly used and cited
			datasets in the UK today. The data displayed here was collated using a combination of 
			metadata available in published papers and online platforms (such as Closer Discovery and 
			the datasets own webpages). No raw data was accessed for the purpose of this project.</p>
		</div>
		<div class = "box two_boxes" >
			<p style = "font-family:Wellcome">Known limitations:</p> 
			<p> We know that the groupings of sub-populations used in the datasets, e.g. ethnicity groupings, 
			are subjective and potentially inaccurate at times.</p>

		<p>Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) is a database containing details of all admissions,

		over 200 million records with a wide range of information about an individual patient 
		admitted to an NHS hospital such as diagnoses, operations, demographics, and administrative 
		information. It is often used by linking to other datasets such as the UK Biobank.</p>

		<p> This shows how each demographic group is represented in comaprison to the makeup of the UK. 
		This is calculated by taking the percent of a group in a data set and dividing it by the percent 
		of that group in the UK population. For example: If women make up 10% of a dataset, and women 
		comprise 50% of the population at large, that means this dataset has 20% of the number of women 
		required to be truly representative in this metric (this doesnt include missing data)</p>
